# Source code
This folder should include the following:

- source code of your django web application
- a **requirements** file to specify which version of different libraries you have used.
- the **email backend** in the project settings should be set to: django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend
- all html pages should be properly connected so one can navigate easily in the application
